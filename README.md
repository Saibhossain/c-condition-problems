# C Condition Problems

This repository contains solutions to **basic conditional problems in C**.  
The problems are taken from a set of exercises where only **single `*` difficulty** problems were solved.  
Each problem is implemented in a separate `.c` file.

## ðŸ“˜ How Conditions Work in C

Conditions in C are built using **decision-making statements**. These allow a program to **take different paths based on logical checks**.

### ðŸ”¹ The `if` Statement
```c
if (condition) {
    // executes if condition is true
}
```

The if-else Statement
```c
if (condition) {
    // executes if condition is true
} else {
    // executes if condition is false
}
```
